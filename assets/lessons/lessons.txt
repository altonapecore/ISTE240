Basic Unix / miscellaneous  

Tutorial 0 

Login 

In order to start up Unix, the user would need to access a terminal for it. On a Windows machine, click the Windows key and R key simultaneously. This would open a prompt, from there, type cmd and click on run. On a Mac, click on the magnifier glass at the top right of the screen. It should open a search prompt and type in “Terminal”.  


rwx  

rwx is used to set permissions for files and directories. R stands for read, or who can read the file. This should always be set by default. W stands for write, or who can write into the file. Finally, x stands for execute, for who can run the file. In Unix, these are represented with numbers, 0 through 7. If the file has a 0 next to it, it just means there are no permissions. A 1 means it can be executed. A 2 means it can be written in. A 3 means it can be written in and executed. A 4 means it can be read. A 5 means it can be read and executed. A 6 means it can be read and written in. And a 7 means it can be read, written in, and executed.  


man command 

The man command is used to bring up a manual for any command. This is extremely useful for when the user needs to search up what a specific command does or just forget what does.  


whoami 

The whoami command simply just shows the user who they are currently logged in as in the terminal. It can be useful if there are multiple people who use the computer and log into the terminal. 


ls  

The ls command is used to show the user all the directories and files that the user can go to.  

Tutorial 1 

Files 

cat 

The cat command is used to read off the contents of the file to the user. Simply inputting cat followed by the file name would provide the user with the contents by reading the file.  


cp 

The cp command is used to copy files. There are some condictiones to this, however. The first being that if it is in the same directory, it needs to have a different name. The contents can still be the same. But, if the file is going to a different directory, it can be either have a different name or the same name. Learn more about directories in the next topic. 


mv 

The mv command is used to rename the file. The way it works is that it creates a new file with the new name that you have provided, moves all the content from that old file onto the new one, then deletes the old file. That move of content is why is it mv instead of one that is more related to renaming. The way to do this is: mc oldfile newfile , replacing oldfile with the file you wish to be replaced and replacing newfile with the file you wish to rename it to.  


rm 

The rm command is used to remove a file.  


vi  

The vi command is used to view the file.  


Tutorial 2 

Directory 

pwd 

The pwd command is used to show the current directory that the user is in. It shows the root that it takes, going from the shell to the current directory. 


cd 

The cd command is used to allow the user to change directories.  


md/mkdir 

The md or mkdir command is used to make a new directory.

gzip 

The gzip command is used to compress down a file and turn it into a .gz file implying that it is zipped and compressed.  


gzcat 

The gzcat command is used to check the contents of a zipped file.  


gunzip 

The gunzip command is used to unzip a file, changing it back to the original file type instead of a .gz and thus resorting the file back to the number of bytes it was before the compression.  


Tutorial 4 

Advanced Directory / git commands 

clone 

The clone command will create a copy of the directory in the current one.  


open 

The open command will open the directory inside of your file finder.  


Tutorial 5 

Coding 

$ 

The $ is called the command prompt. This implies that a command can be inputted and executed when it is present at the start.  


echo 

The echo command is used to print out lines or inputs that the user feed it. This works with strings or variables that the user gives it. For example, inputting $ echo “Hello” with provide the user with the word Hello on the next line.  


ping 

The ping command is usually used to check if you are connected to the internet. Usually, a user will ping their own ip address and check to see if they get a ping back in return. This also works with other ip addresses or domains such as Google.com
